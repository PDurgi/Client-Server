**Multi-Threaded TCP-IP Chat Application**

### Overview

This multi-threaded chat application, developed by Pooja Durgi, leverages TCP-IP protocols to facilitate real-time communication among users. It emphasizes signal handling and network multiplexing techniques, all while adhering to object-oriented design principles in C++. The project focuses on modularity and maintainability, making it an ideal choice for developers interested in understanding socket-based networking and custom application-layer protocols.

### Features

- **Multi-Threaded Architecture**: The chat application employs a multi-threaded design, allowing multiple clients to connect simultaneously and engage in chat conversations.

- **Custom Application-Layer Protocol**: We've designed a custom application-layer protocol specifically for this chat server and clients. This demonstrates our expertise in socket-based networking and our commitment to crafting efficient communication solutions.

- **Scalability**: The server supports multiple clients, with the ability to handle up to 7 terminals, each accommodating a maximum of 7 users. This scalability makes it suitable for various chat scenarios.

### Getting Started

#### Server Setup

1. Open a terminal.
2. Type `make` to compile the server code.
3. Execute the server by running `chat_server.x serverconfig.txt`.

#### Client Setup (Repeat for Each Client)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Type `make` to compile the client code.
3. Execute a client by running `chat_client.x clientconfig.txt`.
